    "firstParagraph": "In June this year, I obtained a master's degree in Information Systems in Security at the Naval Academy in Gdynia. I learned the basics of programming in college, but I became more interested in this topic only in mid-2019. At the beginning I tried Python, but after a short time I moved to the world of the front-end.",

    "secondParagraph": "It turned out to be a hit. The front-end got me hooked from the beginning. After learning HTML and CSS, I finally decided to learn JavaScript thoroughly. After learning the solid basics of JS, I made a few projects to consolidate my knowledge and was faced with the choice of a framework. My first choice was Vue, but after learning its basics, I tried React, which, incidentally, is a library with great possibilities, not a full-fledged framework. I liked it straight away. After learning the basics, I decided to combine learning React with TypeScript and take full advantage of the typing capabilities, which make it easier to, for example, avoid errors in the code.",

    "thirdParagraph": "After getting to know React, it was time for back-end solutions. Knowing JS, I chose Node.js while learning it with the MongoDb database. Thanks to this, my pages could gain new functionalities.",

    "fourthParagraph": "Recently, I decided to go a step further and learn Gatsby.js. For now I have mastered its basics and am still honing my skills, but I plan to learn Next.js as well. In the meantime, I got to know many libraries that facilitate the work of developers and allow you to bring websites to a higher level."
