    "firstParagraph": "In June of 2020, I obtained a master's degree in Information Systems in Security at the Naval Academy in Gdynia. I learned the basics of programming in college, but I became more interested in this topic in mid-2019. At the beginning I tried Python, but after a short time I moved to the world of the front-end.",

    "secondParagraph": "Currently I am a Frontend developer with 3 years of commercial experience. I started as an intern at Hedea from my hometown. I worked there during the last year of my studies, which were remote at that time due to the pandemic situation. In that place I gained my first experience and learned good practices. After a year, I decided to look for a job in the city where I wanted to live permanently, i.e. Gdynia. Then I also was hired in Netguru, where I work to this day. In Netguru I went from junior to regular role and it was here that I gained a huge dose of knowledge and skills related to international projects.",

    "thirdParagraph": "During my commercial career, I have participated in many international projects. Thanks to this, I developed my skills in the field of good code development practices, design patterns, got to know many new libraries, and also learned how to work in multicultural teams. This experience allows me to efficiently overcome emerging challenges."
