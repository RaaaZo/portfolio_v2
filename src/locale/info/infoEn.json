  "header": "Web design became my passion in the middle of last year. Since then, I have learned numerous technologies. Some of them have been more to my liking than others. Thus, ever since I have discovered React, I stayed with it for longer. In the meantime, I also learned Node.js, which allows me to quickly create a fully-fledged backend for websites when combined with MongoDB. In the near future, I want to learn a technology that will let me write mobile applications. It will probably be ReactNative.",
