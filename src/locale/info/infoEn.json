  "header": "Creating websites became my passion in the middle of last year. I have learned a lot of technologies since then. Some I liked more than others. Therefore, after getting to know React, I stayed with it for longer. In the meantime, I also learned Node.js, which in combination with MongoDB allow you to quickly create a full-fledged backend for websites. In the near future, I want to learn about the technology that allows me to write mobile applications. This will likely be ReactNative",
